## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

Create `.env` from `.env.example` if desired:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run

Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Normal mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5000?board=demo
```

## Testing

1. Open the board in two browser windows.
2. Enter different usernames/colors.
3. Click **Join Board** in both windows.
4. Draw in either window.
5. Verify the stroke appears in the other window.
6. Move the pointer and verify the collaborator cursor.
7. Open a third window with the same `board=demo` URL.
8. Verify previous strokes are loaded.
9. Test **Undo**.
10. Test **Clear Canvas** and verify every connected client clears.

## Room Isolation

Different board IDs create separate rooms:

```text
http://localhost:5000?board=design
http://localhost:5000?board=team-a
http://localhost:5000?board=project-1
```

Users in one board do not receive drawing or cursor events from another board.

## Submission

Suggested GitHub repository name:

`itm-assignment-11-whiteboard-socket`

For the live demonstration, show two or three browser windows connected to the same board and demonstrate:

- simultaneous drawing
- cursor synchronization
- history synchronization for a new joiner
- undo
- clear
